## Important research Questions to answer:

 ### 1. Does the overall revenue increase over time?
 
I can be seen that the revenue for 2019 is higher than that of 2018 and for 2020, no conclusion can be made as data stops in July of 2020.

### 2. How does the hotel type affect the revenues?

City hotel revenues increase at a higher precentage than resort hotel over the period under study.
