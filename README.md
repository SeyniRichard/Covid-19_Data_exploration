### Data Transformation before SQL queries

After downloading the csv file from the link above. Save two tables separately; one showing Covid data (from A to Z) and another showing vaccination data (Qualitative columns A to E and the from AA to end) after saving them add them to the SQL server then start the SQL queries.

### [Data visualisation:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/seyni.richard.sano/viz/Coviddashboard_16310300073660/Dashboard1)

After creating some queries in sql we transfer the resulting datasets into excel (Only acceptable format for Tableau public) so that they can be visualised in tableau. the resultant visualisation is shared here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/seyni.richard.sano/viz/Coviddashboard_16310300073660/Dashboard1
